title: "DIY Private Container Registry"
date: "2023-09-21 15:00"
event: "Open Source Summit EU 2023"
description: |
    The growing adoption of containerization and container orchestration has amplified the need for secure and controlled distribution of container images.
    This talk delves into the process of distributing private container images and OCI artifacts,
    examining the strengths and weaknesses of various solutions in relation to specific use cases,
    such as software sales and customized builds for clients.

    We compare different approaches, beginning with hosted registries that provide cost-effectiveness, streamlined implementation,
    and minimal maintenance, although they possess inherent limitations. Subsequently, we investigate a range of open-source solutions,
    from turnkey options that are user-friendly and low-maintenance but may offer limited integration capabilities,
    to constructing fully bespoke solutions using low-level building blocks, which grant extensive customization possibilities.

    Join us as we navigate the ever-evolving world of constructing private container distribution using open-source software
    and assist you in determining the most appropriate approach tailored to your unique needs and requirements.

# Let me tell you a story...

::: {.notes}
- Distribute images to customers
- Design partners
:::

## Requirements

- Share container images with design partners
- Target environments
    - developer machine
    - CI
    - container orchestrator
- → Flexible authentication and authorization
- Minimize operational burden (monitoring, backup, etc)

::: {.notes}

## Available solutions

Cloud-hosted

P2P

All-in-one solutions

Plain old registries

## Cloud-hosted registries

- Pros
    - Easy to set up
    - No operational burden
- Cons
    - Requires cloud provider account
    - Manual IAM setup

::: {.notes}
Surprisingly, companies were not eager to register cloud provider accounts.
:::

## New requirements

- No cloud provider registration required
- Flexible authorization (eg. entitlement-based)

::: {.notes}
More design partners and customers
More projects with more container images
:::

## Back to research

~~Cloud-hosted~~

Harbor
:::

## Harbor

- Structures artifacts into projects
- Robot accounts for service-to-service auth
- Simple authorization
- Image replication
- Uses [Distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution) as a registry

![](assets/harbor-logo.png){.absolute top="-50" right=0 width="200"}

::: {.notes}
Tons of features

How we used Harbor
:::

## Harbor quirks and cons

- Group based access for users, but not for robot accounts
- Cross-project robot account creation requires admin access
- API integration only works with the admin credentials
- Complex software for a specific use case
- Operation is not trivial

::: {.notes}
But: can use object store due to Distribution
:::

## New requirements

- Self-serve portal
- Closer integration with sales and licensing systems

::: {.fragment}
**Maybe it's time to build our own solution.**

# How do container registries work?

## OCI {transition="slide-in fade-out"}

![](assets/oci.embed.svg){fig-align="center"}

## OCI {#oci-no-auth transition="fade-in slide-out"}

![](assets/oci-no-auth.embed.svg){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- HTTP interface -> Basic auth (if the client supports it)
- Authz?
:::

## Docker registry auth "specification"

aka. `docker login`

- Token based authorization
- OAuth2 protocol

::: {.notes}
- Not a formal spec
- Documented under the Distribution project
:::

## {#docker-token-auth-flow}

![](assets/docker-token-auth.embed.svg){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
1. Client attempts to begin an operation with the registry
2. If the registry requires authorization it will return a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP response with information on how to authenticate
3. Client makes a request to the authorization service for a token
4. Authorization service returns a token representing the client's authorized access
5. Client retries the original request with the token embedded in the request's Authorization header
6. Registry authorizes the client by validating the token and the claim set embedded within it and begins the operation as usual
:::

# Let's put it all together

## Plain old registries

- Distribution
- Zot

::: {.notes}
- CNCF Sandbox projects
:::

## Distribution

- Reference Docker registry implementation
- Major providers rely on it

[https://github.com/distribution/distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution)

![](assets/distribution-logo.png){.absolute top="-50" right=0 width="150"}

::: {.notes}
- Supports various object stores
- Providers: Docker Hub, GitHub CR, GitLab CR, DigitalOcean CR, Harbor
- Team is focused on v3
- Last minor version is from 2022
- Doesn't support workload identities (see [this](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/issues/3756) issue)
:::

## Zot

> A production-ready vendor-neutral OCI-native container image registry (purely based on OCI Distribution Specification)

- Registry auth is currently [broken](https://github.com/project-zot/zot/issues/1125)

[https://zotregistry.io](https://zotregistry.io)

![](assets/zot-logo.svg){.absolute top="-100" right=0 width="200"}

::: {.notes}
- Donated by Cisco
- Supports object stores
:::

## Portward

- Registry auth [library](https://github.com/portward/registry-auth) and [service](https://github.com/portward/portward)
- Build your own with the _library_
- Use an existing integration with the _service_
- ⚠️ **Work in progress!**

# Registry auth caveats

- Not a formal specification
- There are several [gaps](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/discussions/3744) in it
- Competing, but incompatible specs (eg. [ChartMuseum Auth](https://github.com/chartmuseum/auth-server-example))
- Partial implementations

# Future: OCI Auth spec

- OCI Auth working group
- Fairly new (first meeting: August 1, 2023)
