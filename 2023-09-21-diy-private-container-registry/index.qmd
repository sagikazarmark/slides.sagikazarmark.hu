title: "DIY Private Container Registry"
date: "2023-09-21 15:00"
event: "Open Source Summit EU 2023"
description: |
    The growing adoption of containerization and container orchestration has amplified the need for secure and controlled distribution of container images.
    This talk delves into the process of distributing private container images and OCI artifacts,
    examining the strengths and weaknesses of various solutions in relation to specific use cases,
    such as software sales and customized builds for clients.

    We compare different approaches, beginning with hosted registries that provide cost-effectiveness, streamlined implementation,
    and minimal maintenance, although they possess inherent limitations. Subsequently, we investigate a range of open-source solutions,
    from turnkey options that are user-friendly and low-maintenance but may offer limited integration capabilities,
    to constructing fully bespoke solutions using low-level building blocks, which grant extensive customization possibilities.

    Join us as we navigate the ever-evolving world of constructing private container distribution using open-source software
    and assist you in determining the most appropriate approach tailored to your unique needs and requirements.

# Let me tell you a story...

## Requirements

- Share closed-source images with target group of
    - people
    - machines
    - services
- → Flexible authentication and authorization
- No operational burden (monitoring, backup, etc)

## CNCF Landscape

## Available solutions

Cloud-hosted

P2P

All-in-one solutions

Plain old registries

## Cloud-hosted registries

- Pros
    - Easy to set up
    - No operational burden
- Cons
    - Requires cloud provider account
    - Manual IAM setup

::: {.notes}
Surprisingly, companies were not willing to register AWS/GCP accounts.
:::

## New requirements

- More flexible authentication (ie. custom auth provider)
- Flexible authorization

## Back to research

~~Cloud-hosted~~

Harbor
:::

## Harbor

- Structures artifacts into projects
- Robot accounts for service-to-service auth
- Simple authorization
- Uses [Distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution) as a registry

![](assets/harbor-logo.png){.absolute top="-50" right=0 width="200"}

::: {.notes}
Tons of features

How we used Harbor
:::

## Harbor quirks and cons

- Group based access for users, but not for robot accounts
- API integration only works with the admin credentials
- Complex software for a specific use case
- Operation is not trivial

::: {.notes}
But: can use object store due to Distribution
:::

## New requirements

- Self-serve portal
- Closer integration with sales and licensing systems

::: {.fragment}
**Maybe it's time to build our own solution.**

**Plain old registries**

# How do container registries work?

## OCI

## No auth in OCI distribution spec

## Docker registry auth "specification"

TODO

# Let's put it all together

## Plain old registries

- Distribution
- Zot

## Distribution

- Reference Docker registry implementation

## Zot

TODO

## Registry authentication

TODO

# Demo {background-gradient="linear-gradient(45deg, #1b2975, #479fdf)"}

# Registry auth caveats

- Not a formal spec
- There are several [open questions](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/discussions/3744)
- Competing, but incompatible specs (eg. [Chartmuseum Auth](https://github.com/chartmuseum/auth-server-example))

# Future: OCI Auth spec

- OCI Auth working group
- Fairly new (first meeting: August 1, 2023)
