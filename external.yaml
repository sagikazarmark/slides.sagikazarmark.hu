    You've just perfected CI and/or CD for your organization, again.
    It was a huge, frustrating effort, and learning another proprietary DSL or YAML didn't deliver the promised tenfold increase in release frequency.
    It wasn't the first re-platform and it won’t be the last. Now that things have calmed down, there must be a way to prepare, to future-proof your CI/CD and protect developers,
    the business, and your sanity. In this talk we’ll demonstrate how to use abstraction, containerization, DAGs,
    and general-purpose programming languages that your team already knows to create portable CI/CD workflows that can run anywhere without rewriting everything.
    We’ll also highlight how this approach has additional benefits like composability, reuse, testing of CI/CD code itself,
    and fast feedback loops for developers (since you can run these pipelines locally).
    This talk is aimed at anyone who is expecting to have to re-platform CI/CD again in the future (that’s you) and just wants the pain to stop.
