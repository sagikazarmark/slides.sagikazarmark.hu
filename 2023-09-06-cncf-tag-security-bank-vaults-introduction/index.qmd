# Problem

## Kubernetes secret management is _tricky_

- Secret distribution
- Secret storage
- Managing access to secrets

## Secret distribution

- Synchronize secrets to Kubernetes from central store (_External Secrets_)
- Inject secrets into containers (_Bank-Vaults_)
- Load secrets directly from store by the application (_store specific SDKs_)

# History

## Banzai Cloud

**Mission:** Help companies with digital transformation

**Solution:** All-in-one platform to run containerized applications

<br>

**Enterprises need solutions to specific problems**
