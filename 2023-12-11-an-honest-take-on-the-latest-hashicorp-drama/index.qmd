# Timeline {.nostretch}

# BUSL: Business Source License

- Source available license
- Created by MariaDB in 2013
- Limits production use (requires a commercial license)
- Change license: license changes back to this after 4 years

[https://spdx.org/licenses/BUSL-1.1.html](https://spdx.org/licenses/BUSL-1.1.html)

## Free vs Open vs Available

_All_: free to copy, modify, distribute code (under the same license)

- Free Software: derivative works must be free as well
- Open Source: do whatever you want, but keep the license
- Source Available: limits production use

## BSL vs BUSL

- BUSL is often referred to as BSL
- BSL: Boost Software License

[https://spdx.org/licenses/BSL-1.0.html](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSL-1.0.html)

## HashiCorp BSL

- Based on MariaDB's BUSL 1.1
- Additional use grant: allow production use, unless you are a competitor ^[Trouble starts here]
- Change license: MPL 2.0 (after 4 years)
- [FAQ](https://www.hashicorp.com/license-faq) (**not legally binding**)

[https://www.hashicorp.com/bsl](https://www.hashicorp.com/bsl)

## HashiCorp BSL: additional use grant ^[Until Oct. 17, 2023; [original text](https://web.archive.org/web/20230812012558/https://www.hashicorp.com/bsl)]

> You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided such use does not include offering the Licensed Work to third parties on a hosted or **embedded** basis which is **competitive** with HashiCorp's products

## Update (Oct. 17, 2023)

Added clarification to the additional use grant for what is considered _competitive_ and _embedded_, making the interpretation legally binding.

[Current text](https://web.archive.org/web/20231114045445/https://www.hashicorp.com/bsl)

## Embedding

> [...] packaging the competitive offering in such a way that the Licensed Work must be accessed or downloaded for the competitive offering to **operate**.

- What if a software MAY download a HashiCorp product (but works fine without it)? ü§∑
- Does it have to be licensed under BUSL? ü§∑

# Why, HashiCorp, why?

> However, there are other vendors who take advantage of pure OSS models, and the community work on OSS projects, for their own commercial goals,
> without providing material contributions back.

[Announcement](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license)

::: {.notes}
Talk about material contributions later
:::

## Real reason

- Competitors have built products on HC OSS projects
- HashiCorp is trying to capture part of their revenue

::: {.notes}
- First rule of Open Core: separate Open Source from the product
- HashiCorp failed to productize Terraform (and other OSS projects) in a sustainable way
- They could have just forbid commercial use for competitors
:::

# Community reactions

::: {.notes}
- Outrage
- Justified?
- Not all intentions are as good as they appear to be
:::

## RIP Open Source

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Past contributions
- Future contributions?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](assets/rip-opensource.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- Terraform is a hugely successful OSS project
- People feel betrayed
- OSS is a place for innovation
:::

## HashiCorp claims to be the good guy

> without providing material contributions back

::: {.notes}
- Hard to gather data
- People complain about HC not merging contributions
:::

## Concerns about the license

- Vague language is up for interpretation
- License could change again

# {#opentofu .nostretch}

![](assets/opentofu-logo.svg){width="40%"}

- Formerly OpenTF
- Terraform fork
- Linux Foundation project

[https://opentofu.org](https://opentofu.org)

::: {.notes}
- Initially petitioned HC to reverse their decision
- Tensions were high, they quickly moved to fork (~2 weeks)
- They are getting closer to the first release
:::

## Promise

- Truly open source
- Community-driven
- Impartial
- Layered and modular
- Backwards-compatible

::: {.notes}
- There are various claims about future backwards compatibility
- OpenTofu ran a successful PR campaign against HC
- Toned down the rethoric since
:::

## Who is behind it?

| Company                            | Pledge  | Age      | Terraform product |
|------------------------------------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| [Harness](https://www.harness.io/) | 5 FTEs* | 7 years  | Partly            |
| [Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/) | 5 FTEs* | 4 years  | Yes               |
| [env0](https://env0.com/)          | 5 FTEs* | 5 years  | Yes               |
| [Scalr](https://scalr.com/)        | 3 FTEs* | 12 years | Yes               |

::: aside
*for at least 5 years (**not legally binding**)
:::

::: {.notes}
- Startup companies with financial interest in Terraform staying open source (for the moment)
- First pledge: Spacelift
- Motivation???
- They get to be the good guys
- LF support so early ... could be dangerious
:::

# What's next?

## Terraform vs OpenTofu

- End users are silent
- Large companies want to avoid the legal minefield

::: {.notes}
- I don't mean startups, but the billion dollar companies
:::

## The saga contnues: OpenBao

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- Vault fork
- LF Edge (pilot) project (led by IBM)
- Not officially endorsed yet

## What will HashiCorp do?

- Will they join OpenTofu?
- Will they change the license again?

::: {.notes}
- HC seem to have underestimated the competition
- Do they have anything in their sleeves? (eg. patented features)
- HC pledged to support non-BUSL versions until the end of the year
:::

# Final thoughts

::: {.notes}
- Some of the community outrage is justified
- HashiCorp could have built better products based on OSS
- OpenTofu is a successful PR campaign, but it's not over yet
- More companies seem to be interested in BUSL (eg. ArrangoDB)
- Sad, but should serve as a wake up call
:::

# Thank you

_Any questions?_
